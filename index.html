<h1> SCREAM .. the best horror film to exist </h1>

<p class="intro"> <strong><em>"Do you like scary movies?" </em></strong> The horror, the mystery, the plot twist, what isn't there to love about the cult classic <em>Scream</em>. I never fully watched the original <em>Scream</em> till I went to a drive in movie theater, once I watched it I was hooked. I think that the first kill, Casey <em>(Drew Barrymore)</em>, really reels you in. This first kill made it so you did't go through such a slow burn. Not only that, they hired a famous actress reel you in even more only to see her killed off in the first 5 minutes. That's what I like about <em>Scream</em>, they don't drag it on, they get to the point. Till the ending plot twist that you wouldn't have expected. I'll make sure not to spoil.

<p class="p">	I've gotten to the point where I've seen it enough times to appreciate Wes Cravens details. I've watched the recent <em>Scream 2022</em> film that just came out it paid homage to Craven. I enjoyed the film but let's be honest it's just a reboot. <em>Scream (1996)</em> is a film that is great on it's own. The killers weren't one sided like the ones in the following films. I mean come one, if we didn't make it to the 3rd film we wouldn't have had to see <em>Courtney Cox's</em> terrible mini bangs (poor woman). But, we continued to watch because the main protagonist, Sidney <em>(Neve Campbell)</em>, always manages to stay the finale girl. 

<p class="p"> Make sure to read  <a href="https://movieweb.com/scream-slasher-genre-save-how/">How Scream Saved the Slasher Genre </a> !! It talks about how at the time movies just weren't scary anymore they were all cliches and not taken literally. <em>Scream</em> really paved the way for the next decade.</p>
